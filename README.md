CS-300 Analysis and Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, I explored various data models such as Binary Trees, Hash Tables, and Linked Lists and determined how they best fit within specific applications.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

To address the challenges, I delved into the inherent advantages and disadvantages of each data structure, ensuring I utilized them where their benefits were most pronounced.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Whenever I faced difficulties, I often referred to the official documentation for clarification or browsed for practical examples. At times, I also crafted rudimentary prototype codes and built upon them as the complexity of the logic increased.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Diving deep into big-O analysis has refined my perspective on performance and algorithmic design. The course also illuminated my non-intuitive approach to recursive thinking, revealing potential shortcomings in my design strategies.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Experience has been my greatest teacher. For instance, after crafting numerous file streams, I've established a go-to function for future projects. Moreover, I'm considering consolidating recurrent elements to form a library for enhanced efficiency.
